Queclinkdoc
===========

Queclinkdoc is a simple, clean, and less-configured theme for the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation system developed by `Queclink Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd <https://www.queclink.com>`_.

We show the global **TOC** tree of the documentation in a drop-down list at the head of the page, and even if you browse to the end of the page, this TOC tree will still be fixed at the head, so you can jump to other pages at any time.

You can make and install **queclinkdoc** theme like this:

.. code-block:: Python

   py setup.py sdist
   py -m pip install dist\queclinkdoc-x.x.tar.gz
